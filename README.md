###MooCollab

I'm currently taking two MOOC's on Coursera, and I find it difficult to form study groups with classmates to collaborate with in real-time.

> What do you mean by collaboration?

* Tackling problem set questions together
* Peer reviewing each others work
* Topic Discussion

> Does this collaboration have to happen in person?

Not necessarily. There are a number of ways to collaborate online in real-time.

> Can't you just collaborate on online discussion forums?

In a way, yes. But forums are not real-time, and they serve more as Q&A platforms, which is more appropriate for hosting asynchronous discussion.

> Doesn't Coursera have a meetup site that allows you to form study meetups?

Sure, Meetup was designed for in-person meetups, so naturally the groups are location-based. Although this is great for students seeking out local study groups, it alienates both those who do not have the time to travel and meet up in person, and those who simply don't want to.

And even though Meetup was designed for in-person meetups, it wasn't designed for a particular kind of meetup: study groups. It's actually quite restrictive, and here's why:

1) Unlike most events on Meetup, ad-hoc study groups do not typically have a predetermined venue, so finding a space to accomodate everyone is a tremendous logistical challenge. In fact, if you go on meetup, you'll notice that despite most meetup events are missing meetup locations. Great, we have 20 people who RSVP'd for the HCI course who live within a 10 mile radius. Now what?

2) Study groups that contain more than 3-5 people are usually not very productive. Sure, the events can be capped, but for first time meetups with high likelihoods of no-shows, it's a very risky (and perhaps unwise) bet. But if it's not capped, the responsibility of organization falls on the organizer.

3) How do people stay in touch?

So planning a study session successfully on Meetup is no simple feat. And much of that planning falls in the hands of the person organizing, which I find unfair.

> So what's MooCollab trying to do?

Basically, take the pain of forming both online and offline study groups out of the hands of students. Students should not feel like event organizers. 

MooCollab will be achieve this goal by simplifying the process of forming study groups, finding existing ones, and staying connected with fellow classmates.
